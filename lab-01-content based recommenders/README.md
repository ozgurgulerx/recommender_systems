# H1Content Based Recommender Systems 
Content based recommenders (CBR) are the simplest recommender systems. \
A typical CBR, recommends items similar to users preferences e.g. the items liked by the user in the past.\
A CBR calculates item similarity from item attributes (meta-data) e.g. item description.\
Similarity can simply be calculated by vectorizing items and using cosine similarity score to asses similarity of items.
